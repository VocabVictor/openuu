/// Show a popup menu that contains the `items` at `position`.
///
/// `items` should be non-null and not empty.
///
/// If `initialValue` is specified then the first item with a matching value
/// will be highlighted and the value of `position` gives the rectangle whose
/// vertical center will be aligned with the vertical center of the highlighted
/// item (when possible).
///
/// If `initialValue` is not specified then the top of the menu will be aligned
/// with the top of the `position` rectangle.
///
/// In both cases, the menu position will be adjusted if necessary to fit on the
/// screen.
///
/// Horizontally, the menu is positioned so that it grows in the direction that
/// has the most room. For example, if the `position` describes a rectangle on
/// the left edge of the screen, then the left edge of the menu is aligned with
/// the left edge of the `position`, and the menu grows to the right. If both
/// edges of the `position` are equidistant from the opposite edge of the
/// screen, then the ambient [Directionality] is used as a tie-breaker,
/// preferring to grow in the reading direction.
///
/// The positioning of the `initialValue` at the `position` is implemented by
/// iterating over the `items` to find the first whose
/// [PopupMenuEntry.represents] method returns true for `initialValue`, and then
/// summing the values of [PopupMenuEntry.height] for all the preceding widgets
/// in the list.
///
/// The `elevation` argument specifies the z-coordinate at which to place the
/// menu. The elevation defaults to 8, the appropriate elevation for popup
/// menus.
///
/// The `context` argument is used to look up the [Navigator] and [Theme] for
/// the menu. It is only used when the method is called. Its corresponding
/// widget can be safely removed from the tree before the popup menu is closed.
///
/// The `useRootNavigator` argument is used to determine whether to push the
/// menu to the [Navigator] furthest from or nearest to the given `context`. It
/// is `false` by default.
///
/// The `semanticLabel` argument is used by accessibility frameworks to
/// announce screen transitions when the menu is opened and closed. If this
/// label is not provided, it will default to
/// [MaterialLocalizations.popupMenuLabel].
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [PopupMenuItem], a popup menu entry for a single value.
///  * [PopupMenuDivider], a popup menu entry that is just a horizontal line.
///  * [CheckedPopupMenuItem], a popup menu item with a checkmark.
///  * [PopupMenuButton], which provides an [IconButton] that shows a menu by
///    calling this method automatically.
///  * [SemanticsConfiguration.namesRoute], for a description of edge triggered
///    semantics.
